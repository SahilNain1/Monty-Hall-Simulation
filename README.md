# Monty Hall Simulation

## Description
This is a Python simulation of the Monty Hall problem, a classic probability puzzle. It demonstrates the advantage of switching doors (~2/3 win probability) versus staying (~1/3).

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install numpy`
2. Run the script: `python monty_hall.py`

## Example Output
Probability of winning when switching: 0.6694 (Expected: ~0.6667)
Probability of winning when player stays: 0.3306 (Expected: ~0.3333)
